# Fleek Front-End Assignment

Within this codebase, I built the solution to the Fleek assignment on building a web app for listing characters from the Rick and Morty TV Show via the (REST Rick and Morty API)[https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation].

## Development Notes: 

### Packages Used: 
- React-router-dom ( for routing )
- React-icons ( for SVG icons used )
- Redux-toolkit ( for state management )
### Installation: 
- Clone the GitHub repository
- Install application dependencies using a package manager. I recommend using yarn with the `yarn install` command. 
- View the application running on your local host via your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
